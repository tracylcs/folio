abstract="Recently, Abebe et al. (KDD 2018) and Chan et al. (WWW 2019) have considered 
an opinion dynamics optimization problem that is based on a popular model for social 
opinion dynamics, in which each agent has some fixed innate opinion, and a resistance 
that measures the importance it places on its innate opinion; moreover, the agents 
influence one another's opinions through an iterative process. Under certain conditions, 
this iterative process converges to some equilibrium opinion vector. Previous works gave 
an efficient local search algorithm to solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem, for 
which the goal is to modify the resistance of any number of agents (within some given range) 
such that the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. On the other hand, it was proved 
that the L0-budgeted variant is NP-hard, where the L0-budget is a 
restriction given upfront on the number of agents whose resistance may be modified.

Inspired by practical situations in which the effort to modify an agent's resistance 
increases with the magnitude of the change, we propose the L1-budgeted variant, in which
the L1-budget is a restriction on the sum of the magnitudes of the changes over all agents' 
resistance parameters. In this work, we show that the L1-budgeted variant is NP-hard via a 
reduction from vertex cover. However, contrary to the L0-budgeted variant, a very technical 
argument is needed to show that the optimal solution can be achieved by focusing the given 
L1-budget on as small a number of agents as possible, as opposed to spreading the budget over 
a large number of agents.",
