abstract="Recently, Abebe et al. (KDD 2018) and Chan et al. (WWW 2019) have considered an opinion dynamics optimization problem that is based on a popular model for social opinion dynamics, in which each agent has some fixed innate opinion, and a resistance that measures the importance it places on its innate opinion; moreover, the agents influence one another's opinions through an iterative process. Under certain conditions, this iterative process converges to some equilibrium opinion vector. Previous works gave an efficient local search algorithm to solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem, for which the goal is to modify the resistance of any number of agents (within some given range) such that the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. On the other hand, it was proved that the {\$}{\$}L{\_}0{\$}{\$}L0-budgeted variant is NP-hard, where the {\$}{\$}L{\_}0{\$}{\$}L0-budget is a restriction given upfront on the number of agents whose resistance may be modified.",
